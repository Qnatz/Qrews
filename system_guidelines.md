Below is a concise summary of each working function and tool you now have, along with guidelines on how your agents can invoke and use them in practice. Treat this as a reference for any agent that needs to echo text, parse JSON, remember context, or write files.
1. Environment Configuration
All of these tools rely on a properly configured LiteLLM/Gemini 1.5-Flash (or 2.0-Flash) endpoint. Before any agent runs, ensure the following environment variables are set (once, at startup):
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here" export LITELLM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER="google" export LITELLM_DEFAULT_MODEL="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash" # or gemini-2.0-flash 
​This ensures that litellm.completion() calls target Gemini with the correct key.
2. Available Tools and Schemas
2.1. EchoTool
• Purpose:
Simply returns exactly the string you provide. Useful for debugging, validating that function-calling is wired correctly, or any agent that needs to “repeat back” or verify input.
• Schema (JSON-declared to Gemini):
{ "name": "EchoTool", "description": "Returns exactly what it receives.", "parameters": { "type": "object", "properties": { "text": { "type": "string", "description": "The text to echo" } }, "required": ["text"] } } 
• Local Implementation (inherits BaseTool):
class EchoTool(BaseTool): name: str = "EchoTool" description: str = "Echoes back the input text" def _run(self, text: str) -> str: print(f"[EchoTool Invoked] Input: '{text}'") return f"Echo: {text}" 
• How an Agent Uses It:
• Agent registers EchoTool() in its tools list.
• In the prompt, tell Gemini: “Please use the EchoTool to repeat: <whatever text>. Do not answer directly.” 
• When Gemini returns a "tool_calls" response (e.g. { "name":"EchoTool", "arguments": { "text": "..." } }), the orchestrator: 
• Instantiates EchoTool()
• Calls EchoTool._run(text=…)
• Captures and returns that “Echo: …” string back to the user or next agent.
2.2. WriteToFileTool
• Purpose:
Writes arbitrary text into a local file. Agents can use this for logging, code generation (save a new .py, .js, etc.), or any scenario where persistent output is needed.
• Schema:
{ "name": "WriteToFileTool", "description": "Writes provided text to a file with the specified filename.", "parameters": { "type": "object", "properties": { "filename": { "type": "string", "description": "The name of the file to write to." }, "content": { "type": "string", "description": "The content to write into the file." } }, "required": ["filename", "content"] } } 
• Local Implementation:
class WriteToFileTool(BaseTool): name: str = "WriteToFileTool" description: str = "Writes content to a file" def _run(self, filename: str, content: str) -> str: try: with open(filename, "w") as f: f.write(content) print(f"[WriteToFileTool] Wrote to '{filename}'") return f"Written to {filename}" except Exception as e: return f"Failed to write to {filename}: {e}" 
• How an Agent Uses It:
• Agent registers WriteToFileTool() in its tools list.
• In the prompt, tell Gemini to produce a function call that matches the schema: “Please write 'Some content' into a file named 'output.txt'. Respond only with the appropriate function_call JSON (do not reply in plain text).” 
• Gemini returns: { "tool_calls": [ { "function": { "name": "WriteToFileTool", "arguments": "{\"filename\":\"output.txt\",\"content\":\"Some content\"}" } } ] } 
• Your orchestrator parses that tool_calls entry: 
• Extracts {"filename":"output.txt","content":"Some content"}
• Calls WriteToFileTool._run(filename="output.txt", content="Some content")
• Receives back "Written to output.txt" (or an error message).
• The agent or orchestrator can then confirm the file exists and proceed.
3. Memory and JSON-Parsing Utilities
Beyond those two explicit tools, you also have utility patterns that most agents will need:
3.1. Pydantic Parsing with ToolInfo
• Purpose:
Validate and transform a JSON string (returned by Gemini) into a strongly typed Python object, so downstream code can access attributes directly.
• Model Definition:
class ToolInfo(BaseModel): tool_name: str use_case: str language: str 
• How to Use:
• Gemini is prompted to return something like: { "tool_name": "LangGraph", "use_case": "Stateful chains", "language": "Python" } 
• If Gemini puts triple-backticks around it, strip them first: if raw.strip().startswith("```json"): raw = raw.removeprefix("```json").removesuffix("```").strip() 
• Parse with: import json data = json.loads(raw) tool = ToolInfo.model_validate(data) 
• Now tool.tool_name, tool.use_case, and tool.language are guaranteed to exist and be the correct types.
3.2. Short-Term “Memory” Simulation
• Purpose:
Demonstrate that Gemini can “remember” earlier user messages within the same conversation turn.
• How It Works:
• Build a messages list with multiple entries: convo = [ {"role": "user", "content": "My dog's name is Brutus."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nice name!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What’s my dog’s name?"} ] response = completion(model="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash", messages=convo) 
• Gemini returns: "Your dog's name is Brutus." 
• Agents can chain this approach to preserve context across multiple calls, though for anything beyond a few turns, you’ll need to accumulate messages manually.
4. Putting It All Together in an Agent Workflow
Below is a simplified blueprint your coding assistant can follow when building new agents that need any of these tools:
• Decide Which Tool(s) Are Needed
• If you only need to echo or debug, register EchoTool.
• If you need file output, register WriteToFileTool.
• You can also register both—Gemini will choose whichever matches the user’s request.
• Register Tools in the Agent
agent = Agent( role="FileWriterAgent", goal="Generate code and save it to disk", backstory="Expert in code synthesis and deployment", tools=[EchoTool(), WriteToFileTool()], verbose=True, allow_delegation=False ) 
• Write the Task Prompt to Force a Tool Call
• Format the prompt so that Gemini returns exactly the function_call—even if you know code generation is required: “Please write a Python function that says Hello. Then save it to a file named 'hello.py'. Respond only with the appropriate function_call JSON for WriteToFileTool.” 
• Intercept Gemini’s Response
response = completion( model="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash", messages=[{"role":"user","content":your_prompt}], tools=[{ "type": "function", "function": echo_schema }, { "type": "function", "function": write_file_schema }] ) # response.choices[0].message.tool_calls → list of calls 
• Execute the Tool Locally
tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0] fn_name = tool_call.function.name fn_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments) if fn_name == "WriteToFileTool": tool = WriteToFileTool() result = tool._run(filename=fn_args["filename"], content=fn_args["content"]) # result now contains "Written to <filename>" 
• You can do similar logic if { "name": "EchoTool" } was returned.
• Return or Log the Output
• After writing the file (or echoing), decide what the agent’s next action is: 
• If this is the final step, send result back to the user.
• If further steps are required (e.g., compile the file, test it), chain another Gemini call or local subprocess.
5. Example: “Generate and Save Flask App”
As a concrete example for your coding assistant:
• Agent Setup:
flask_agent = Agent( role="FlaskGenerator", goal="Create and save a minimal Flask application", backstory="Expert in Python web frameworks", tools=[WriteToFileTool()], verbose=True, allow_delegation=False ) 
• Task Prompt:
“Generate a Python Flask app with a single endpoint '/' that returns 'Hello World'. Save the code into a file named 'app.py'. Respond with exactly this function_call JSON for WriteToFileTool: { "function_call": { "name": "WriteToFileTool", "arguments": { "filename": "app.py", "content": "<insert generated Flask code here>" } } }” 
• Orchestrator Logic:
response = completion( model="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash", messages=[{"role":"user","content":task.prompt}], tools=[{"type":"function","function":write_file_schema}] ) tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0] fn_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments) result = WriteToFileTool()._run( filename=fn_args["filename"], content=fn_args["content"] ) # Now 'app.py' exists in the working directory 
• Next Steps in Workflow:
• You could spawn a subprocess to run flask run or simply confirm existence.
• If errors occur, parse error text and send back to Gemini for debugging.
6. Final Recommendations
• Reuse Schemas, Don’t Duplicate: Store each tool schema (e.g. echo_schema, write_file_schema) in a central module (e.g. schemas.py). Agents can import and pass them to completion(...) whenever needed.
• Abstract Orchestration Logic: Encapsulate the “call → parse → execute tool → return result” pattern into a helper function, so each agent’s code stays minimal.
• Agent Roles & Tasks:
• EchoAgent: For simple debugging, verifying harness.
• FileWriterAgent: For saving any generated content (code, logs, data) to disk.
• JSONParserAgent: (not strictly a tool) uses Pydantic for structured inputs.
• MemoryAgent: Maintains conversation state across tasks.
• Error Handling: If Gemini chooses not to call any tool, have a fallback path (e.g., respond with “Tool call not detected; repeating answer in text”).
• Security Cautions:
• If writing arbitrary files, ensure you sanitize filename (no path traversal like ../../etc/passwd).
• Limit write location to a known sandbox (e.g., /data/data/com.termux/files/home/…).
In Summary
Your coding assistant now has:
• EchoTool – for simple “repeat‐back” checks.
• WriteToFileTool – to persist any string to a local file.
• Pydantic parsing – to validate JSON structures returned by Gemini.
• Memory context – to demonstrate Gemini’s ability to recall previous messages.
Each tool is a standalone BaseTool subclass with a matching JSON schema. Gemini’s role is to decide (via tool_calls) which function to invoke. Your orchestrator code:
• Provides tools=[{"type":"function","function":schema}, …] to completion().
• Parses response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0].
• Calls the corresponding local tool class via _run(...).
Use these patterns for any new agent you build. This ensures tools seamlessly integrate into multi-agent flows, enabling your assistants to echo, parse, remember, and write to files without additional dependencies.
