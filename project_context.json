This could be due to several reasons: the server is not running, the server is running on a different port, or there is a network issue preventing the connection. I need to examine the code to see how it's trying to connect to the LLM server and identify the configuration. I'll start by searching for the string \"http://localhost:8080/v1/completions\" to find the relevant code.\nAction: search_in_files\nAction Input: {\"search_query\": \"http://localhost:8080/v1/completions\"}\nObservation: {'results': []}\nThought: Since I couldn't find the exact string, I'll search for \"localhost:8080\" to see if the address is constructed dynamically.\nAction: search_in_files\nAction Input: {\"search_query\": \"localhost:8080\"}\nObservation: {'results': []}\nThought: I'll try searching for \"v1/completions\" to see if I can find the API endpoint being used.\nAction: search_in_files\nAction Input: {\"search_query\": \"v1/completions\"}\nObservation: {'results': []}\nThought: Since I can't find any references to the LLM server address, I'll try searching for \"LLM\" or \"completions\" to find the relevant code that uses the LLM.\nAction: search_in_files\nAction Input: {\"search_query\": \"LLM\"}\nObservation: {'results': []}\nThought: I'll try searching for \"completions\" to find the relevant code that uses the LLM.\nAction: search_in_files\nAction Input: {\"search_query\": \"completions\"}\nObservation: {'results': []}\nThought: It seems I cannot find any explicit configuration for the LLM server. This suggests that the LLM server address might be defined in an environment variable or a configuration file. I'll try searching for \"os.environ\" to see if environment variables are being used.\nAction: search_in_files\nAction Input: {\"search_query\": \"os.environ\"}\nObservation: {'results': []}\nThought: I'll try searching for \"config\" to see if there's a configuration file being used.\nAction: search_in_files\nAction Input: {\"search_query\": \"config\"}\nObservation: {'results': []}\nThought: Since I can't find any explicit configuration in the project files, it's possible that the LLM connection is happening in a library or module that's not directly visible in the project. Without more information about the project structure and dependencies, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the error.\n\nHowever, the error message itself suggests that the LLM server is expected to be running locally at http://localhost:8080. The most likely cause of the error is that the LLM server is not running.\n\nTo fix this, I would need to:\n\n1.  Ensure that the LLM server is running locally at http://localhost:8080.\n2.  If the server is running on a different port, I would need to update the code to use the correct port.\n3.  If there is a network issue, I would need to resolve it.\n\nSince I don't have access to the code that connects to the LLM server, I can't provide a specific code fix. However, I can provide a general solution:\n\nFIXED CODE:\n```\n# Ensure that the LLM server is running locally at http://localhost:8080.\n# If the server is running on a different port, update the code to use the correct port.\n# If there is a network issue, resolve it.\n```\n\nPREVENTION:\nTo prevent this issue from occurring in the future, I would recommend the following:\n\n1.  Use a configuration file or environment variable to store the LLM server address. This will make it easier to change the server address without having to modify the code.\n2.  Implement error handling to gracefully handle the case where the LLM server is not available. This could involve retrying the connection, logging an error message, or using a fallback mechanism.\n3.  Provide clear instructions on how to set up and run the LLM server.\n```python\n\n```\nFinal Answer: The error \"Error: Could not connect to local LLM server at http://localhost:8080/v1/completions\" indicates that the LLM server is not running or is not accessible at the specified address. Ensure the LLM server is running, the port is correct, and there are no network issues. Use a configuration file or environment variable for the server address, implement error handling, and provide clear setup instructions to prevent this issue in the future.",
