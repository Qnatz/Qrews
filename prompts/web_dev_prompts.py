Prompts for Web Development Crew Agents

This module defines prompts for various web development agents.
It avoids using .format() at the module level to prevent KeyErrors during import.
Placeholders like {role}, {specialty}, {project_name}, {common_context}, etc.,
are intended to be formatted at runtime by the prompt retrieval mechanism
(e.g., get_agent_prompt in general_prompts.py).
